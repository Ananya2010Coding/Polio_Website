        <p id="txt">You must be thinking that what even is this Polio?? When you look at that kid over there, you might get memories of
            when you were younger like 3 or 4 and someone comes knocking at the door. When you open, the person comes, and he/she grabs you to squirt a sweet drop in your mouth and give your little pinky 
            finget a purple mark. That droplet is the <b>VACCINE</b> for polio and the mark is the identification that you had the droplet.
            <br><br>
            Poliomyelitis, commonly shortened to polio, is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. Poliovirus is usually spread 
            from person to person through infected matter entering the mouth. It may also be spread by food or water. Polio is not 
            curable and mostly affects young children.
            <br>
            When a person gets infected, the nervous system and organs are affected resulting in paralysis. A person can not cure it
            but stay away from it and take meausures to prevent it. Vaccination is the best and most effective way to cure polio.
            <br><br>
            Some light symtoms of POLIO can be:-
            <br>
            Sore throat, Fever, Tiredness, Nausea, Headache, Stomach Pain, Paresthesia, Meningitis, Paralysis.         
            <br><br>
            Now lets talk about our nation INDIA. In 1995, India had launched a Pulse Polio Programme to make India a <b>POLIO-FREE Nation</b>
            And India achhieved it when WHO declared it on 27th March 2014. India still makes sure that each citizen is aware of polio
            and keeps track that no infected person from another country comes here 24/7. Nationwide, the vaccine is given twice to 
            each and every child at every house in the cities and the villages. 
            <br><br>
            The Vaccine for Polio was a hard job. But, luckily <b>Dr Jonas Salk</b> was the person responsible for inventing the Polio
            Vaccine. There are 2 types of Polio Vaccine - 
            <b>Inactivated Polio Vaccine(IPV)</b> and <b>Oral Polio Vaccine(OPV)</b>. IPV was the vaccine injected whereas OPV was the 
            droplet I was talking about earlier.
            <br><br>
            The whole nation celebrates <b>POLIO DAY</b> on 24th October. I know it is new but important. World Polio Day 
            highlights the importance of polio vaccination and measures to eradicate it. In India, in several hospitals, schools, 
            organisations, etc polio drives are expected to organise. People are motivated and information is provided about 
            the simple method of immunisation and how it saves them from a lifelong disability.
