      <p class="description">Polio(short for <b>Poliomyelitis</b>) was the most infectious diseases in the previous generations.
      It is similar to Coronavirus but did a lot more different damage to human life. If you were at that time then oh lord, 
      you see symtoms get crazier. It must be really excrucuating to listen to all of this. But it is for your own better life.
      You will get to know something apart from Covid-19.</p>

      <p class="note">For your knowledge, I have created this website where you can explore more about Polio by clicking
        on the buttons.
